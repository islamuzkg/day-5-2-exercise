# Think about how you would do this manually.
# If you had a list like this:
# [10, 6, 8, 2, 4, 12, 3]
# To find the max manually, you would start with the first number, 10, and that would be the max. Then you move to the next number, 6:
#  M
# [10, 6, 8, 2, 4, 12, 3]
#      ^
# Is it bigger than 10? No, then move to the next number:
#  M
# [10, 6, 8, 2, 4, 12, 3]
#         ^
#  M
# [10, 6, 8, 2, 4, 12, 3]
#            ^
#  M
# [10, 6, 8, 2, 4, 12, 3]
#               ^
#  M
# [10, 6, 8, 2, 4, 12, 3]
#                  ^
# Now we come to a number that IS bigger than our max of 10. So then we move the max point:
#                  M
# [10, 6, 8, 2, 4, 12, 3]
#                  ^
# Then continue:
#                  M
# [10, 6, 8, 2, 4, 12, 3]
#                      ^
# The list is finished now, and M points at 12.
# Now you just need to code it up!
